## Stage 1 - 🎢 Journey with UI Libraries

<br/>

### React-Bootstrap

- Used for complicated components only
- Self-implemented atomic components like Button, Checkbox, Avatar

<br/>

### Material-UI (MUI)

- Reason: Modern API and better theming support
- Benefits: Hooks, customization, and best practices integration
- Challenge: Struggles with complex custom components

## Stage 2 - 😅 The Struggles with Custom Components - Props Jungle

```ts {*|1}
const Modal = ({ isOpen, onClose, title, children }) => {
  if (!isOpen) return null;

  return (
    <div className="modal">
      <div className="modal-header">
        <h2>{title}</h2>
        <button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
      </div>
      <div className="modal-content">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```ts {6-7}
const Modal = ({
  isOpen,
  onClose,
  title,
  children,
  width,
  height,
})
```

```ts {8}
const Modal = ({
  isOpen,
  onClose,
  title,
  children,
  width,
  height,
  customClassName,
})
```

```ts {9-12}
const Modal = ({
  isOpen,
  onClose,
  title,
  children,
  width,
  height,
  customClassName,
  closeOnOverlayClick,
  onOpen,
  onCloseComplete,
})
```

```ts
const Modal = ({
  isOpen,
  onClose,
  title,
  children,
  width,
  height,
  customClassName,
  closeOnOverlayClick,
  onOpen,
  onCloseComplete,
  ...
})
```

<!--
Examples: Autocomplete, Combobox, Multi-tag-select, Dropdown, Modals

Issues: Difficulties in enforcing design and functionality

Conclusion: MUI was not flexible enough for unique needs

## 💡 Discovering Headless Components

- Introduction to Headless Components: Accessible components without styling

<br/>

### Benefits Realized

- **♿ Accessibility**: Pre-built, well-tested components
- **🎨 Flexibility**: Complete control over design and rendering logic - using the power of **inversion of control**
- **🚀 Performance**: Reduced bundle size by importing only what's needed

---
