## Stage 1 - üé¢ Journey with UI Libraries

### React-Bootstrap

- Used for complicated components only
- Self-implemented atomic components like Button, Checkbox, Avatar

### Material-UI (MUI)

- Reason: Modern API and better theming support
- Benefits: Hooks, customization, and best practices integration
- Challenge: Struggles with complex custom components

## Stage 2 - üòÖ The Struggles with Custom Components - Props Jungle

```ts {*|1}
const Modal = ({ isOpen, onClose, title, children }) => {
  if (!isOpen) return null;

  return (
    <div className="modal">
      <div className="modal-header">
        <h2>{title}</h2>
        <button onClick={onClose}>Close</button>
      </div>
      <div className="modal-content">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

```ts {6-7}
const Modal = ({

```ts {8}

  closeOnOverlayClick,

<!--
Examples: Autocomplete, Combobox, Multi-tag-select, Dropdown, Modals

Issues: Difficulties in enforcing design and functionality

Conclusion: MUI was not flexible enough for unique needs

## üí° Discovering Headless Components

- Introduction to Radix UI: Accessible components without styling

### Benefits Realized

- **‚ôø Accessibility**: Pre-built, well-tested components
- **üé® Flexibility**: Complete control over design and rendering logic
- **üöÄ Performance**: Reduced bundle size by importing only what's needed
